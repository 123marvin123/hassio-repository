Network-wide ad blocking

## About

[Pi-hole][pi-hole] is an advertising-aware DNS- and web server, meant to be run
on a dedicated Raspberry Pi connected to your home network. Pi-hole lets you
block advertisements for every device that connects to your network without the
need for any client-side software.

This add-on is a port of Pi-hole to be able to run on Home Assistant and
is based on Alpine Linux and is using Docker.
